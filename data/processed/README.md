Processed data are stored in this folder. These data were processed by mean of code in `data/data_formatting`.

Datasets:
- "Data_Processed_10000nm.csv" - the 2nd version of full dataset. 9300 elements, FEM computation grid: (L, t1, t2, w) = (10000, 2, 3, 5).
- "Data_Processed_1000nm.csv" - small dataset with extremely fine grid. 200 elements, grid: (L, t1, t2, w) = (1000, 2, 5, 7).
- "Dataset_Processed.csv" - the 3rd (and final) version of full dataset. 5300 elements, grid: (L, t1, t2, w) = (5000, 2, 3, 5).
- "Data_Processed_Boundary_Test.csv" - dataset that can be used for model durability test. Contains object with input parameters distributed in a wide range of values what makes a model to struggle trying to predict outputs on these inputs.
