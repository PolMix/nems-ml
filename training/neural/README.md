Here you can find notebooks for the study of processed dataset by means of neural machine learning models.

## Neural ML (`main_neural_ml.ipynb`)
Here Multilayer Perceptron (`MLP`) and Branched MLP (`BMLP`) models are trained. Visual comparison of MSE and R2 metrics for these models is performed, calculation time is estimated.

## Loss wrapped neural model (`loss_wrapped_neural_model.ipynb`)
`BMLP` model with trainable loss coefficients in loss function:

## Neural models visualization (`neural_models_visualization.ipynb`)
Visualization of `MLP` and `BMLP` models structure.

## Shap neural ml (`shap_neural_ml.ipynb`)
Explaining `MLP` model outputs by means of SHAP values.
